These changes include the ability to monitor impacts from forest disturbances with higher spatial detail and frequency than ever before thanks to the availability of new satellites and cloud computing. Progress also depends on our ability to transfer this technology in ways that make sense to those who need it. With these applied needs in mind, this Forest Service Research and Development initiative is designed to demonstrate the forest monitoring that is now possible, to refine ways that these capabilities can be best adapted for managers, and to improve insights about eastern US forest dynamics more fundamentally.\nHiForm leverages 10-meter resolution Sentinel-2 imagery from the European Space Agency because of its detail and frequency. We also research landscape applications of LiDAR and new approaches to track forest dynamics at this level of detail for longer term planning and monitoring. Our emphasis is on eastern US forests, with particular focus on the Southeast and Appalachians.\nFor weekly MODIS (240 meter) resolution change maps for the conterminous US, see our sister project, ForWarn ll."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/frontPage/"}}}
