Hurricane Irma struck south Florida in September of 2017 and caused substantial impacts to the coastal mangrove forest.  Prior to this event, this same area was impacted by Hurricane Katrina that passed over the peninsula to land a second time in Louisiana. Much of the damage shown here is from leaf stripping of the mangrove along the coast, and after Katrina, this came back after about a year. Interior departure in NDVI may result from partial inundation by water as only the open water is masked out in black.
