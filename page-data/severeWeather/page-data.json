This includes exploring the usefulness of different vegetation indices and developing current, up-to-date forest type masks to filter results with emphasizes on events that occur in the eastern US.</p>\n<p>A common problem with remote sensing-derived estimates of forest impacts from disturbance is translating observed change in some metric--often an index like NDVI--with actual damage we care about. We often resort to terms like \"relative severity\" and couch expectations in terms of \"likely impacts\" because change in an index only correlates with damage, it's not a perfect measure. This results from many factors, but an important one is differences in vulnerability of the target vegetation to damage. Some species or cover types are unduly sensitive to a given high wind or fire intensity--and their response may not reflect actual damage. A major monitoring challenge in the eastern US comes from leaf stripping in deciduous forests that causes little or no structural damage to the trees. This phenomenon is readily-observed but is of minor-concern, and it is caused by high wind or hail. In the spring, leaves often re-emerge after a few days to weeks with low or no impact to the growing season peak greenness, although it may shorten the growing season and productivity by a few weeks. While ephemeral defoliation and regrowth can mask substantive structural damage, it can also exaggerate impacts immediately after the storm passes. Leaf stripping is not a factor in deciduous forests in the non-growing season, and its importance increases as the canopy closes during spring. For the eastern US, this means that our observed measures of change have different ecological implications across seasons as well as vegetation types.</p>\n<p>HiForm monitoring helps in two ways: (1) at 10m it can provide a more precise understanding of vegetation type and its vulnerability to different types of damage (i.e., structural versus ephemeral) especially when impacts are mapped by deciduous and conifer types separately; and (2) impacts are resolved through seasonal-repetition, so that impacts can be contextualized by their duration and response during different times of year.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Severe Weather","description":"This markdown generates content for the severe weather page"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/severeWeather/"}}}
